    "\n",
    "Practical 10 is split into two notebooks - one examining relationships in Heathrow Weather and Air Quality data (10a) and one examining relationships in NS-SeC and house prices data (10b). The two notebooks are self-contained and can be used independently. You should decide which sets of data you most likely want to use for your final report, and work through the corresponding notebook during supervised practical time. This will give you the basics of analyses that you can then build on for your final report. Of course, you are welcome to work through both notebooks, although you are unlikely to be able to complete both during class time. "

    "1. import packages required for functionality in the remiander of the notebook and set `matplotlib` font parameters \n",
