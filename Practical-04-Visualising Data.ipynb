    "Last week we did some basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with the MetOffice weather data, but it was limited to mainly looking at a few graphs right at the end of the practical. Thanks to that, depending on the data you got you may spotted a 'problem' or two (_e.g._ temperature readings at the start or end of the time series that were basically 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we want to tackle this in a more systematic way. We are going to switch data sets because the Socio-Economic data is easier to manipulate than the weather data and it has a few features that are particularly useful for demonstrating the value of transformation and standardisation."

    "## Introduction: all models are wrong, but some are useful\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistician George Box [once said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) \"all models are wrong but some are useful\". Now you might think that 'wrong' _necessarily implies_ uselessness, but this aphorism should tell you that things are a lot more interesting than that: let's review the idea of statistics as the study of a '[data-generating process](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9639.2012.00524.x/full)'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we work with is a _representation_ of reality, it is not reality itself. Just because I can say that the height of human beings is normally distributed with a mean of, say, 170cm and standard deviation of 8cm doesn't mean that I've _explained_ that process. What I have done is to say that reality can be reasonably well approximated by a data-generating process that uses the normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that understanding of height distributions, I know that someone with a heigh of 2m is very, very improbable. Not impossible, just highly unlikely. So if I meet someone that tall then that's quite exciting! But my use of a normal distribution to represent the empirical reality of human height doesn't mean that I think it is _actually_ distributed randomly amongst all human beings in a gigantic lottery system: some parts of the world are typically shorter, other parts typically taller; some families are typically shorter, while others are typically taller...\n",
    "\n",
    "So the _real_ reason for someone's height is to do with, I assume, a mix of genetics and nutrition. However, across large groups of people it's possible to _represent_ the cumulative impact of those individual realities with a simple normal distribution. And using that simplified data-generating process allows me to do things like estimate the likelihood of meeting someone more than 2m tall (which is why I'd be excited to do so, though not as excited as the guy in the next video...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a (genuinely terrifying) video that tries to explain this whole idea in a different way:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![From reality to make-believe](http://img.youtube.com/vi/HAfI0g_S9oo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAfI0g_S9oo)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, real individuals earn different incomes for all sorts of reasons: skills, education, negotiation ability... and, of course, systematic discrimination or bias. Because of wide variations in individual lived experience, it's quite hard to _prove_ that any _one_ person has been discriminated against unless you have the 'smoking gun' of an email or other direct evidence that this has happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if I have data on _many_ men and women (from a company, industry, or society) to work with, then I can take a look at what data-generting processes best describe what I've observed. And I can also create a data generating process that would describe what I'd _expect_ to see if no systematic discrimination were taking place at all. I make that sound simple but, of course, it's really hard to do this properly: do you account for the fact that discrimination has probably happened throughout someone's lifetime, not just in their most recent job? And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, when we have created a data-generating process that captures this at what we feel is an appropriate level, then the analytical process becomes about testing to see if there is a _significant_ difference between what I expected and what I observed. Once we've done that, then we can start to rule out claims that 'there are no good candidates' and the other defences of the indefensible. It is always theoretically _possible_ that a company had trouble finding qualified candidates, but as you put together the evidence from your model it may well  become increasingly _improbable_.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, always remember that, while the data is not reality, it _is_ a very useful abstraction of reality that allows us to make certain claims about what we expected to see. Linking our observations to what we know about the characteristics of the data generating process then allows us to look at the _significance_ of our results or to search for outliers in the data that seem highly improbable and, consequently, worth further investigation."

    "There is no simple answer to when the mean is, or is not, a good measure to use in an analysis. We'll spend a lot more time on this over the coming weeks, but the answer _seems_ to be: it depends what you are trying to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you were a researcher planning to undertake some in-person interviews in areas that have high concentrations of well-off households (Group 1, basically). How would you go about choosing which LSOAs to target? How could we use the z-score to make this process a little less 'random' than picking a couple of areas that you know well and trundling off to find... exactly what you expected because your choice was influenced _not_ by data but by _personal bias_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this way:\n",
    "1. Remember that _if_ something followed a normal distribution (2-tailed) then you would _expect_ 95% of values to fall within the range of -1.96 to +1.96 standard deviations from the mean. So if you wanted 5% 'significance' then you could say \"I'm going to select everything outside of this range as being _significantly_ over- or under-represented in terms of the Group 1 population at the 5% significance level.\"\n",
    "2. If you wanted to select only the _real_ outliers (say, 99.9% 'significance') then you want that z-score of 3.29 that we used above. If we can see that there are values _way_ beyond that level then we can be pretty certain that there is something non-random happening there... which could be problematic if we thought our model was representing reality but _not_ if we are saying \"naively, we expected reality to work like a random normal, so departures from that expectation are interesting.\" \n",
    "3. The point is that we are moving away from just saying \"Well, it's more than average so it's interesting'. We are actually filtering out a lot areas that might plausibly have higher (or lower) concentrations **'by chance'** _if a normal distribution is a reasonable representation_. We know it's not, but we're stating here that our _naive_ expectation is that people are distributed at random, so what's interesting is the areas where our results show this obviously is _not_ the case. Do you see what I meant above about subtract what we _expected_ from what we _observed_?\n",
    "4. So rather than just saying \"25% of Group 1 households is a lot\" or \"36% of Group 4 households is a lot\" we are finding a way to use the z-score to set a threshold that is less influenced by our own ideas about what is 'significant' and more influenced by what the data actually _says_ is significantly outside 'the norm'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _only_ problem with this approach in this case is that we can tell that our expectation of normality isn't very accurate. The positive skew of Groups 1 and 4 means that we're getting _too many_ areas being flagged as 'significantly over-represented by Group X'. If we were to pick a better distribution, or if we could 'make' the Group distribution _appear_ more like a normal distribution then the z-score would work better for selecting the really interesting cases...\n",

    "We've already done some straightforward plotting directly from pandas, but for the data visualisation part of the practical we are going to use the [Seaborn package](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) because it provides a lot of quite complex functionality (and very pretty pictures) at quite low 'cost' (i.e. effort). There are, however, other options out there that are worth checking out if you take things further; the two that you are most likely to hear mentioned are: [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) and matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bokeh is, like, Seaborn designed to make it easy for you to create good-looking plots with minimal effort. \n",
    "2. Matplotlib is a different beast: it is actually the _underlying_ library that supports the majority of plotting (drawing graphs) in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "So Seaborn and Bokeh both make use of the matplotlib library to create their plots, and if you want to customise a figure from either of these two libraries then you will eventually need to get to grips with matplotlib. The reason we don't teach matplotlib directly is that it's much harder to make a good plot and the syntax is much more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent entrant is ŷhat's ggplot library, which deliberately mimics R’s ggplot2 (http://ggplot.yhathq.com) -- this library has become the dominant way of creating plots in the R programming language and it uses a 'visualisation' grammar that many people find incredibly powerful and highly customisable. Unfortunately, ggplot on Python does not currently support mapping (which R does in ggplot2).\n",

    "5. We save the plot, using the `format` command to replace the `{0}` with the name of the data series (so in this example we'd be saving our figure to `Group1Lq-Test.pdf`).\n",

You could repeat an entire analysis simply by changing the input file (assuming the format doesn’t change too much). \n",
