    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first things that we do when working with any new data set is to familiarise ourselves with it. There are a _huge_ number of ways to do this, but there are no shortcuts to:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>a. Reading about the data (how it was collected, what the sample size was, etc.)</li>\n",
    "  <li>b. Reviewing any accompanying metadata (data about the data, column specs, etc.)</li>\n",
    "  <li>c. Looking at the data itself at the row- and column-levels</li>\n",
    "  <li>d. Producing descriptive statistics </li>\n",
    "  <li>e. Visualising the data using plots </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you should use _all_ of these together to really understand where the data came from, how it was handled, and whether there are gaps or other problems. If you're wondering which comes first, the  _start with a chart_ is always good.  But this week we want you to get a handle on pandas itself so although we will do some plotting, we'll focus on a-d. There will be much more on plotting next week."

The sources and types of data in the initial LSOA dataset we will examine are: \n",

    "# What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas stands for 'Python Data Analysis Library'; it is designed to provide data scientists working in Python with a set of powerful tools to load, transform, and process large-ish data sets. As a result, it has become something of a *de facto* standard for online tutorials and many of the lessons that you can find online will make use of pandas at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond what we provide below there are [numerous](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=introduction+to+pandas+python) useful introductions; [one of our favourites](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/) is from Greg Reda, and there are some [good videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NR-ynQg0YM&list=PLJ5Y5hxm-0W7rOOYBHf6KC6QNnWOi09kh) on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzUfC-2ETruIzZuVajRub1A). And of course, there’s [TONS of stuff](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas) on StackOverflow. If you want an actual physical book, you might try [McKinney (2017)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one thing you will really want to bookmark is [the official documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) since you will undoubtedly need to refer to it fairly regularly. _Note_: this link is to the most recent release. Over time there will be updates published and you _may_ find that you no longer have the most up-to-date version. If you find that you are now using an older version of pandas then you'll need to track down the _specific_ version of the documentation that you need from the [home page](http://pandas.pydata.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always check what version you have installed like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "print pd.__version__\n",
    "```\n",
    "*Note*: this approach isn't guaranteed to work with _every_ package, but it will work with most of them. Remember that variables and methods starting and ending with '`__`' are **private** and any interaction with them should be approached very, very carefully.\n",

Reading and writing that amount of data will slow things down quite a bit! Sometimes it's easier to work with only a portion of the data while we are doing our coding and then, once we know that we've written things correctly, we do our analysis on the whole data set. \n",

If we set up our analysis then the answer is: it doesn't matter!

    "2. We see an '&' (ampersand) which is completely new: it's a logical `AND` that asks pandas to \"Find all the rows where condition 1 _and_ condition 2 are both `True`\". So it calculates the `True`/`False` for the left side and the `True`/`False` for the right side of the `&`, and then combines them. Look at the appendix to this notebook for more examples and options.\n",

    "Kind of handy, no? These aren't the _best_ looking plots, but they are all being generated on-the-fly for you by pandas with no more than a cheery `DataFrame.Series.plot.<plot type>`! Since those plots are all just method calls, many of them take optional parameters to change the colour, the notation (scientific or not), and other options. For example, many of the documentation pages linked to above are rather brief, but include a link to [the general options that can be applied to all `Series.plot`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.plot.html#pandas.Series.plot) calls.\n",

We don't need to know _how_ a draw a KDE plot (though it always helps if you don't see what you expected), we just need to know that pandas provides a method that will do it for you. And _that_ is why it's always worth having a [look at the documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#plotting). "
