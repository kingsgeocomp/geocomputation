A key difference between [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) and [lists](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) is that while elements in lists are ordered, dicts are unordered.

Consequently, an important concept for dicts is that of key-value pairs. "

    "- It turns out that both already have handy Python packages that help you to read the data if you give them the URL of the page to read\n",
    "- Even better, *both* packages have a simple function called `read_data(...)` that takes a URL and extracts the data that you want from that page as a CSV file, except...\n",
    "- Because the web sites are _completely_ different the `read_data(...)` functions are _specific_ to that one web site!\n",

    "\n",
    "If you look closely, then using either of the 'Cities' data files to do anything _useful_ presents something of a 'problem': our list-of-lists isn't very easy to navigate. Notice that not only _might_ the location of the Population column be different in the two files (as it turns out it was, deliberately), but when we want to work out the answer to a simple question such 'what is the 3rd largest city' we need to step through a lot of irrelevant data as well: we'd need to write a for loop and make sure that we skip past the name, latitude, longitude, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't make much sense since this should all be easier and faster in code than in Excel, but right now it's _harder_, and quite possibly _slower_ as well! When you get into situations like this (having to write a lot of code to do something that should be fast and easy) it is often the case that you've got the wrong _data structure_. \n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the experienced programmer get around this? 'Simple' (i.e. neither simple, nor obvious, until you know the answer): she realises that the data is organised the wrong way! We humans naturally tend to think in rows of data: London has the following _attributes_ (population, location, etc.), and York has a different set of attributes. Se we read across the row because that's the easiest way for us to read it. But, in short, a list-of-lists does _not_ seem to be the right way to store this data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, a computer doesn't have to work that way. For a computer, it's as easy to read _down_ a column as it is to read _across_ a row. In fact, it's easier, because each column has a consistent _type_ of data: one column contains names (strings), another column contains populations (integers), and other columns contain other types of data (floats, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "Better still, the order of the columns often doesn't matter as long as we know what they are called: it's easier to ask for the 'population column' than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the population column might be in a different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely to use the 'population' label for the column itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Dictionary of Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we don't care about column order, only row order, then a dictionary of lists would be a nice way to handle things. And why should we care about column order? With our two CSV files above we already saw what a pain it was to fix things when the layout of the columns changed from one data set to the next. If, instead, we can just reference 'population' column then it doesn't matter where that column actually is. Why is that? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, here are the first four rows of data from the simple city file as a list-of-lists:\n",

    "\n",
    "What does this do better? Well, for starters, we know that everything in the 'Name' column will be a string, and that everything in the 'Longitude' column is a float, while the 'Population' column contains integers.

    "\n",
    "The code can look pretty daunting, so let's break it down into two parts.\n",

    "What would you get if you ran just this code?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Population'][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remember that this is a dictionary-of-lists (DoL). So, Python first looks for a key named `Population` in the myData dictionary. It finds out that the value associated with this key is a _list_ (`[9787426, 2553379, 2440986]`). In this example, it just pulls out the first value (index 0), which is `9787426`. Does that make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to the second part:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'].index('Manchester')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very similar: we look in the dictionary for the key `Name` and find that that's _also_ a list (`['London','Manchester','West Midlands']`, since you asked). If you don't remember what `index` does, don't worry, here's the output from Python's `help()` function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Help on built-in function index:\n",

    "index(...)\n",
    "    L.index(value, [start, [stop]]) -> integer -- return first index of value.\n",
    "    Raises ValueError if the value is not present.\n",
    "```\n",
    "So all we're doing is asking Python to find out the index of 'Manchester' in the list associated with the dictionary key 'Name' _instead_ of just sticking in a `0` to get the first index value. Putting these two things back together what we're doing is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding the index (i.e. **row**) of 'Manchester' in the Name column,\n",
    "* Using that index to read a value out of the Population column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the complete _absence_ of a for loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that make sense? If it does then you should be having a kind of an Alice-through-the-Looking-Glass moment because what we've done by taking a column view, rather than a row view is to make Python's ``index()`` command do the work for us. Instead of having to look through each row for a field that matches 'Name' and then check to see if it's 'Manchester', we've pointed Python at the right column immediately and asked it to find the match (which it can do very quickly). Once we have a match then we _also_ have the row number to go and do the lookup in the 'Population' column because the index _is_ the row number!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Easternmost City\n",
    "\n",
    "Where this approach really comes into its own is on problems that involve maths. To figure out the easternmost city in this list we need to find the _maximum_ Longitude and then use _that_ value to look up the city name. So let's do the same process of pulling this apart into two steps:\n",

    "It should be _pretty_ obvious what this does:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'][0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But we don't just want the first city in the list, we want the one with the highest longitude. So to achieve that we need to replace the `0` with an index that we found by looking in the `Longitude` list.\n",

    "myData['Longitude'].index(max(myData['Longitude']))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "    max(myData['Longitude'])\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There's the same `.index` which tells us that Python is going to look for something in the list associated with the `Longitude` key. All we've done is change what's _inside_ that index function to `max(myData['Longitude'])`. This is telling Python to find the _maximum_ value in the `myData['Longitude']` list. So to explain this in three steps, what we're doing is:\n",
    "* Finding the maximum value in the Longitude column (we know there must be one, but we don't know what it is!),\n",
    "* Finding the index (position) of that maximum value in the Longitude column (now that we know what the value is!),\n",
    "* Using that index to read a value out of the Name column.\n",
    "\n",
    "I _am_ a geek, but that's pretty cool, right? In one line of code we managed to quickly find out where the data we needed was even though it involved three discrete steps. Remember how much work it was to find the mean when you were still thinking in _rows_, not _columns_?\n",

    "### The Average City Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Yeah, let's try that too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're going to 'cheat' a little bit: rather than writing our own function, we're going to import a package and use someone _else's_ function. The `numpy` package contains a _lot_ of useful functions that we can call on (if you don't believe me, add \"`dir(np)`\" on a new line after the `import` statement), and one of them calculates the average of a list or array of data.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np # Need to import a useful package\n",

Simply by changing the way that we stored the data in a 'data structure' (i.e. complex arrangement of lists, dictionaries, and variables) we were able to do away with lots of for loops and counters and conditions, and reduce many difficult operations to something that could be done on one line! \n",
