    "\n",
    "The statistician George Box [once said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) \"all models are wrong but some are useful\". Now you might think that 'wrong' _necessarily implies_ uselessness, but this aphorism is a lot more interesting than that: let's review the idea of statistics as the study of a '[data-generating process](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9639.2012.00524.x/full)'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we work with is a _representation_ of reality, it is not reality itself. Just because I can say that the height of human beings is normally distributed with a mean of, say, 170cm and standard deviation of 8cm doesn't mean that I've _explained_ that process. What I have done is to say that reality can be reasonably well approximated by a data-generating process that uses the normal distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that understanding of height distributions, I know that someone with a height of 2m is very, very improbable. Not impossible, just highly unlikely. So if I meet someone that tall then that's quite exciting! But my use of a normal distribution to represent the empirical reality of human height doesn't mean that I think our height is _actually_ distributed randomly using a gigantic lottery system: some parts of the world are typically shorter, other parts typically taller; some families are typically shorter, while others are typically taller...\n",
    "\n",
    "So the _real_ reason for someone's height is to do with, I assume, a mix of genetics and nutrition. However, across large groups of people it's possible to _represent_ the cumulative impact of those individual realities with a simple normal distribution. And using that simplified data-generating process allows me to do things like estimate the likelihood of meeting someone more than 2m tall (which is why I'd be excited to do so, though not as excited as the guy in the next video...).\n",

    "In the same way, different parts of a city may have different characteristics in terms of their physical structure, ethnic composition, affluence, etc, etc...  Because of wide variations in underlying data generating processes, different areas of a city may be similar or different to one another across  multiple different charateristics. But by comparing between locations and examining patterns (including the distriubtion of characteristics and looking at the extremes) we may be able to begin to think about what the underlying processes are.

We can easily compare two percentages to know which one is more, and which less (e.g. I got 80% on one exam and 70% on the other). But let's think about a slightly different question: _which exam did I do better on relative other students?_ What if you got 80% on an exam where everyone else got 85%? Suddenly that doesn't look quite so good right? And what if your 70% was on an exam where the average mark was 50%? Suddenly that looks a lot better, right?\n",

   "source": [
    "### Using the Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start to bring the idea of the 'data generating processes' to life. The first thing to do with the z-score is to look at what it implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Subtracting the mean implies that the mean _is a useful measure of centrality_: in other words, the only reason to subtract the mean is if the mean is _meaningful_. If you are dealing with highly skewed data then the mean is not going to be very useful and, by implication, neither is the z-score.\n",
    "2. Dividing by the Standard Deviation implies that this _is a useful measure of distribution_: again, if the data is heavily skewed or follows some exponential distribution then the standard deviation is not going to very useful as an analytical tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the z-score is _most_ relevant when we are dealing with something that looks vaguely like a standard normal distribution (which has mean=0 and standard deviation=1). In those cases, anything with a z-score more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean is in the 5% significance zone. \n",
    "\n",
    "But remember: we can't really say _why_ one particular area has a high concentration of well-off individuals or why one individual is over 2m tall. All we are saying is that this standardised value is a pretty unlikely outcome _when compared to our expectation that people are randomly distributed across the region_ or _that people have randomly-distributed heights of mean 'x' and standard deviation 'y'_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we _know_ that people aren't randomly distributed around the country in the same way that we know that height isn't genuinely random becuase of the influence of genetics, nutrition, etc. But we need a way to pick out what counts as _**significant**_ over- or under-concentration (or height) from the wide range of 'a bit more' or 'a bit less' than 'normal'. **_If_** a normal distribution does a good job of representing the overall distribution of heights (_whatever_ the reason) then someone of 2m is highly unlikely but we can't say _how_ unlikely until we've placed them on the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put it another way:\n",
    "* Is 10% of wealthy individuals in a small area a high concentration?\n",
    "* How about 20%?\n",
    "* 30%?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to answer that question is to use something like the z-score since it standardises all of the values _against the average_. If wealthy people were distributed at random then we would _expect_ that most areas would have about the average concentration. Some areas will have a few more. Some areas a few less. But according to the way that the standard normal distribution works, _nowhere_ should have a z-score of 10. Or 20, since that is 20 standard deviations from the mean and just shouldn't exist in the lifetime of the universe. So if we see that kind of result then we know two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. That our assumption that normal distribution is a reasonable representation of reality breaks down at some point.\n",
    "2. That there are _some_ areas with _highly significant_ over- or under-representation by wealthy residents.\n",
